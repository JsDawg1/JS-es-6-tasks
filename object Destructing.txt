
1. Basic Object Destructuring
You are given an object representing a car. Write a function that extracts the make and model properties and logs them.

javascript
Copy code
const car = {
  make: "Toyota",
  model: "Corolla",
  year: 2020
};

function logCarDetails({ make, model }) {
  // Your code here
}

logCarDetails(car);
2. Destructuring with Default Values
Write a function that takes an object representing a book and logs its title, author, and genre. If genre is missing, default it to "Unknown".

javascript
Copy code
const book = {
  title: "1984",
  author: "George Orwell"
};

function logBookDetails({ title, author, genre = "Unknown" }) {
  // Your code here
}

logBookDetails(book);
3. Renaming Variables in Destructuring
You are given an object representing a smartphone. Write a function that renames the brand and model properties to phoneBrand and phoneModel during destructuring, and logs them.

javascript
Copy code
const smartphone = {
  brand: "Apple",
  model: "iPhone 14",
  price: 999
};

function logSmartphoneDetails({ brand: phoneBrand, model: phoneModel, price }) {
  // Your code here
}

logSmartphoneDetails(smartphone);
4. Nested Object Destructuring
You are given an object representing a movie. Write a function to extract the title, year, and the directorâ€™s name (nested inside a director object) and log them.

javascript
Copy code
const movie = {
  title: "Inception",
  year: 2010,
  director: {
    name: "Christopher Nolan",
    age: 50
  }
};

function logMovieDetails({ title, year, director: { name: directorName } }) {
  // Your code here
}

logMovieDetails(movie);
5. Function Parameters Destructuring
Write a function that takes an object representing a user with username, email, and isAdmin properties as parameters, destructures it, and logs these values.

javascript
Copy code
const user = {
  username: "jdoe",
  email: "jdoe@example.com",
  isAdmin: false
};

function logUserDetails({ username, email, isAdmin }) {
  // Your code here
}

logUserDetails(user);
6. Destructuring Arrays Inside Objects
You are given an object representing a playlist. Write a function that destructures the name of the playlist and its first two songs.

javascript
Copy code
const playlist = {
  name: "Chill Vibes",
  songs: ["Song 1", "Song 2", "Song 3", "Song 4"]
};

function logPlaylistDetails({ songs: [song1, song2] }) {
  // Your code here
}

logPlaylistDetails(playlist);
These are the questions for you to practice object destructuring!
